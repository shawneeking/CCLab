<h1 class="heading">So What Does it All Mean?</h1>
<p class="paragraphE">Some Important Information:</p>
<ol>
    <li class="list">We have theorized that before the Big Bang, the entire universe was compressed into a single point</li>
    <li class="list">Nobody knows what's inside of a black hole</li>
    <li class="list">A black hole is said to contain the secrets of the universe</li>
    <li class="list">The prelude to the Big Bang is one of secrets of the universe</li>
</ol>
<p class="paragraphE">With this in mind, your mouse represents a human explorer, travelling through the 
    <br>Universe and discovering the unknown.
</p>
<p class="paragraphE">As we venture deep into my fictional black hole, we discover it's singularity,
    <br>where all the matter it has absorbed is condensed into a single point.
</p>
<p class="paragraphE">Upon investigating this singularity, we discover that a whole new cycle has begun anew.</p>
<p class="paragraphE">Hopefully one day, when we are able to venture into a black hole, will we 
    <br>discover what really lies at the center of a black hole, but for 
    <br>now we can only speculate.
